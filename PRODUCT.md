# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Stack

TypeScript, Vite and Three.js, with local data and optional native MuJoCo physics.

## Users

The project owner wants to see Doom video frames formed by actual 3D fruit-fly neuronal geometry, and rotate that geometry to reveal the mechanism.

## Product Purpose

The primary live route must use the complete official FlyWire v783 brain: all 139,255 neurons and every released skeleton vertex and parent link, with their own simulated neural activity. The goal is recognizable arbitrary-video playback through measured synaptic connections, with a connected simulated body. Full-anatomy image quality and real-time performance remain experimental. Earlier selected-site, projection and small whole-arbor experiments are retained as labelled historical comparisons.

## Capabilities and Constraints

- Use real public fly neuron skeletons with source attribution and complete-release coverage audits. Do not substitute invented anatomy.
- Use decoded local video or locally captured Freedoom game frames.
- The projection camera stays fixed while the viewing camera rotates.
- Every pixel contributing to the brain display comes from geometry; the separate source preview is explicitly labeled.
- The original projection page uses point/branch color projection, not neural simulation. The separate neural page derives one brightness per neuron from its simulated spike trace. Keep the distinction visible.
- Use the full published Shiu v783 signed connection table in the neural model. Explain the simplified LIF dynamics and artificial optical input; do not call it natural fly vision.
- The physical body is a scan-derived NeuroMechFly model in MuJoCo. Explicitly identify the engineered descending-neuron-to-gait-controller adapter and absence of a reconstructed VNC, muscles or body-to-brain feedback.
- Let the user interrupt video stimulation and synaptic transmission, reset state, and independently pulse forward-command cells to inspect causality.
- The main view includes all neurons, including externally stimulated cells. Distinguish their spikes from cells receiving only synaptic input. Identified motor-output neurons must not receive direct video stimulation. Target activities never reach the renderer.
- Keep target resolution, complete anatomy counts, anatomical support, one activity per whole arbor, spike filtering and tonic input assumptions explicit. Preserve disconnection, wiring-shuffle and paused-source checks. The earlier selected-site results do not establish full-anatomy performance.
- Retain unsuccessful earlier results as historical comparisons. Do not disguise direct brightness fitting or projection as synaptic computation.
- The live route targets at least 10 new neural outputs per wall-clock second on the measured M5 Pro backend. Source decoding, neural simulation, body physics, and screen refresh have separate clocks. Preserve neural state across frames; never substitute prerecorded neural output. The earlier baseline remains slower than real time.

## Operating Context

Local desktop browser first, with responsive touch controls. Public anatomy data is prepared locally before use.

## Evidence on Hand

Local Freedoom captures provide example stimuli. Public FlyWire data supplies neuronal morphology and measured connectivity.

## Product Principles

The rendered artifact leads. Make the source and method explicit. Preserve actual coordinates and neuron identity. Let exploration reveal the projection's limitations.

## Implementation Assumptions

The user has made the complete publicly released brain a hard requirement. A displayed subset, one observation site per neuron, or further branch downsampling is no longer acceptable for the primary experience. Preserve the complete released skeletons and openly distinguish the publisher's LOD/downsampling from original membrane or EM data. The 616 official neurons absent from the old model have no connections in the public table and remain explicit isolated cells. “Body” means a simulated body; no living fly is connected. High-detail recognition and ≥10 new neural frames/s are goals requiring whole-anatomy evidence, not claims inherited from the previous selected-site version.
