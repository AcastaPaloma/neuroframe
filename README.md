# Neuroframe

A local experiment using the **complete public FlyWire v783 brain**: all 139,255
official neurons, every available skeleton branch, and all 15,091,983 measured
neuron-to-neuron connections (54,492,922 synaptic contacts).

The home page and `live.html` both open [the full-brain experiment](http://127.0.0.1:4173/). The older projection-mapping prototype is archived at `projection.html`.
Its online controller accepts browser-decodable video and changes external
conductances and currents. The simulator produces spikes, and each neuron's spike history lights
its entire released skeleton. **The current RGB trial preserves all neurons and
branches; recognizable high-detail video still fails visual review.** Earlier
grayscale versions sustained about 10 new neural displays/s on the measured M5
Pro machine. Those measurements do not establish the RGB trial's speed. The
older selected-site measurements do not apply to the new renderer.

```sh
cd neuroframe
npm ci
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-body.txt
```

The repository contains source code and the small body assets. The generated
anatomy, operators, example videos and validation caches are excluded from Git.
Prepare them with the commands below before starting the full experiment.
Once prepared, launch the app with `npm run dev:full`.
Use Node.js 24 or later for the TypeScript-based test scripts.

Use a desktop browser with WebGPU, WebGL 2 and hardware acceleration. Full
geometry is several gigabytes; there is no automatic fallback to a neuron subset.
The native MuJoCo service binds only to `127.0.0.1:8769`, retains the same 3.9.0 engine, model and 0.25 ms timestep, and receives only gait controls. Its backend is identified beside the body. Without it, the static application uses the browser WASM body, which was slower in the measured run.

The interface fails explicitly if the complete data or GPU resources are missing.
Local files are decoded on the computer and are not uploaded.

## Use the full brain

The initial view uses **labelled static anatomy inspection** so inactive branches
are visible. Start the experiment to switch to simulated spike activity. Choose
an example or any local video the browser can decode. Video is letterboxed and
converted to a 640 × 480 RGB target in the current default trial. That is
an input size, not a claim of effective image detail. The previous 320 × 240
setting remains at `?controller=visual-inputs&controlWidth=320`. Choose **Grayscale**
under **Neural display**, or open `?color=grayscale`, for the earlier single-channel
encoding. Changing this setting reloads and resets the model.

RGB uses a permanent artificial emission channel for each neuron: 46,415 red,
46,423 green and 46,417 blue. Its entire arbor emits only that channel, with
brightness set by its own scalar spike trace. Channels are fixed by neuron index,
independently of the stimulus. Local cable density is normalized separately for
each channel in both front and orbit views. The external controller receives RGB
targets and requests activity through the same measured graph; the renderer
receives only the resulting spike traces. These are display colors, not measured
biological neuron colors or a model of natural color vision.

Use **Enlarge brain** for a full-window view with playback controls; Escape or
**Return to body** restores the paired view. The same anatomical canvas and activity
remain active, and the body stays connected. Orbit, zoom, or choose a viewpoint
to inspect the unchanged 3D positions. Every
parent link belonging to an official neuron remains present; there are no selected display
cells, one-point observation sites, or newly sampled branches in this route.

Playback preserves neural history across frames, seeks and clip changes. Reset
clears both simulations. Background tabs pause. The first view starts paused;
`?autoplay` starts neural playback after loading unless reduced motion is set.

Disable synaptic transmission, reset, then play to test causality. Directly
stimulated cells may continue firing and remain visible. Cells receiving only
synaptic input must remain silent. Their spike counts are reported separately.
Video stimulation off sets the external currents to zero without clearing state.

## What is real and what is modelled

The geometry and contact counts are measured FlyWire data. The public skeletons
were generated from LOD-1 meshes and downsampled by their publishers. We retain
all vertices and parent links in that release without additional downsampling.
This is complete released centerline anatomy, not the original electron-microscopy
volume, membrane meshes, or a complete biological simulation.

The Shiu model contains 138,639 of the official cells. Reconciliation against the
complete public connectivity table finds **616 additional official neurons with
no listed incoming or outgoing connections**. They are included as isolated
model cells; no missing synapses are invented. The connection tables otherwise
match exactly. All original presynaptic sign assumptions are preserved.

The default experimental feedback controller drives annotated visual afferents
and adjusts conductances on the remaining non-motor cells. It has no constant
seed currents. The input population is fixed independently of the video. Identified descending motor outputs
receive no direct stimulation.
All stimulated cells remain visible. Ordinary thresholding, refractoriness and
incoming synaptic currents remain active on every cell. The controller never
writes voltages, spikes, traces, or rendered brightness directly.

The front view uses a 1280 × 960 cache integrating all 268,139,177 released branches. This is a complete, transparent cable-length projection evaluated from current spike activity; it is not a source-video raster. Orbiting uses the original complete 3D indexed geometry, with a different line-rasterization approximation and a higher draw cost.

The entire arbor shares its neuron's 40 ms exponential spike trace. The renderer
has no source video argument or texture. Whole-neuron activation couples distant
image regions, so a complete brain can produce a less recognizable image than the
older selected-point display. The diagnostic independent-brightness fit is clearly
separate from neural playback and is never a runtime fallback.

The physical NeuroMechFly body uses MuJoCo and an engineered descending-neuron
→ gait adapter. Natural vision, the ventral nerve cord, muscles and body-to-brain
feedback are not reconstructed. The brain and body come from different specimens.
No living fly is connected.

## Reproduce the complete import

For a fresh checkout, install the data tools and prepare the baseline coordinate
origin and public connectivity, then import the complete brain. Run from the
repository root; the public source archive and generated anatomy require many
gigabytes of local storage:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-data.txt
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_live_clips.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_assets.py --only brain --neurons 1500
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_connectome.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/download_full_brain.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_full_brain.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_full_connectome.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_full_basis.py --width 320
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_full_basis.py --width 640
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_full_basis.py --width 1280
.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_render_cache.py
```

The sampled baseline supplies the shared coordinate origin; the complete import
then retains all 139,255 official neurons and all released branches. To prepare
the optional archived sprite-sheet viewers, also run
`.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_assets.py --only clips`. Numerical diagnostics
are separate from acquisition: `scripts/evaluate_full_anatomy.py` computes an
independent-brightness bound, and `scripts/prepare_color_validation.py` creates
the RGB renderer calibration.

The baseline cache prerequisites are the pinned Shiu `Completeness_783.csv` and
`Connectivity_783.parquet` from `prepare_connectome.py`, plus the shared coordinate
origin in `public/data/brain.json`. Public acquisition verifies the publishers'
file sizes and MD5s, then records SHA-256 hashes. The complete runtime manifest
lists every official root ID, model index, neuron/chunk counts and chunk hashes.
Missing neurons, broken parent links or changed source hashes fail the import.
The source archive's extra roots outside the official list are recorded explicitly.

Data and audits live in `.cache/full-brain/`; complete runtime files are in
`public/data/full-brain-783/`. See [FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md](FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md)
for measured progress and remaining limitations.

## Validation and earlier experiments

`npm run build` checks TypeScript and creates a static build. `npm run test:neural`
checks delayed propagation, inhibition, disconnection and the earlier controller.
Full graph and image-control regressions require their prepared `public/data`
fixtures. On a source-only checkout, the independent measurement/color checks run
with `node --test tests/live-measurements.test.ts tests/neural-color.test.ts`.
The development-only `gpu-test.html` additionally checks CPU/GPU agreement,
normal tonic-current refractoriness, downstream silence after cutting transmission,
controller buffer execution and full-size indirect event dispatch. RGB checks
cover every neuron channel assignment, primary-color stimulation through the
GPU circuit, and downstream silence after a transmission cut.

For the complete renderer, generate the independent RGB calibration with
`.venv/bin/python scripts/prepare_color_validation.py`, run
`node scripts/collect_full_validation.mjs`, then open `/render-cache-test.html`
on the development server. This checks every RGBA component, zero emitted light
from inactive neurons, neutral full activity and unchanged grayscale output.
The calibration vector is synthetic and is never used as neural playback.
`full-bench.html?color=rgb&controller=gate` enables RGB in the full-graph harness;
use the parameters recorded in FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md to reproduce the current trial.

New neural frames/s counts distinct decoded frames through GPU draw completion,
with body physics active. Capture latency includes that completion, but physical
monitor scan-out is outside the measurement. Screen refreshes are not counted.
Keep other experiment tabs paused during benchmarks.

## Event-gated full-brain trial

The earlier event controller remains at `?controller=events`, and
`?controller=tonic` preserves the earlier baseline. It simulates every
official neuron and renders every released branch. A fixed 700-cell excitatory
population receives tonic current; 138,543 other cells receive strong external
conductance control, and the 12 identified motor outputs remain unactuated.
Conductance prepares cells below threshold and is released when a requested spike
and a positive measured synaptic current coincide. Brightness remains the owning
neuron’s 40 ms spike trace, with a fixed 1.5× display exposure.

**The image information comes from extensive external control.** The measured
connectome supplies and constrains the emitted spikes. This is not a biological
stimulation protocol or evidence of natural visual processing. The conductance is
very strong (16,384 times the baseline leak in the software model). Cutting
transmission after reset silences all non-seed cells in the tested sequences.

The trial improves spatial correspondence in the tested clips, but high-detail,
recognizable arbitrary-video playback is still unproven. Three-tick integration
retains the original 0.2 ms step and 1.8 ms synaptic delay. GPU validation checks
one-, three-, and nine-tick batches against the same CPU reference.

`scripts/audit_spike_reachability.py` records a necessary connectivity bound;
`full-bench.html` accepts `hold=1.9` for stationary-target diagnosis and `audit`
to export requested and measured rates for every neuron. `fit=0.95` tests a
geometry-derived supported target window. That smaller framing is diagnostic
only and is not used by the full UI.

The event controller corrects its requests from the emitted spike image and
supports underactive cells through the signed measured graph. Upstream support
requires current image demand, so stale requests cannot sustain background
firing after a dark cut. On 60 tuning frames, supported MSE falls from 0.005545
to 0.005244; the first two matched corridor frames preserve stronger edges.
The measured full application sustains 10.56 new displays/s with 66.2 ms mean
processing latency and 76.3 ms p95 on this Mac, including complete anatomical
draws and the connected native body. Decoder-to-draw latency averages 81.1 ms
(121.9 ms p95), excluding display scan-out. That speed does not establish visual
quality. `event-support-live-performance.json` records the measured window.

`Latest evaluation · 640 × 480 / 35 FPS` contains maps 04, 08 and 12 generated
after the new controller was frozen. The earlier evaluation is also retained.
The trial links a **recorded diagnostic** showing the new source and actual
simulated spikes through two scene cuts. It is never used as runtime output.
Temporal correspondence passes this check; scene edges remain weak and the
recognition criterion still fails. See `scripts/evaluate_frozen_sequence.py`,
`scripts/audit_anatomical_limit.py`, and [FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md](FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md)
for the measurements and their scope.

The numerical harness also accepts `controlWidth=640`. Its exact operator includes
every branch. It costs more compute and does not improve matched edge detail at
either common 320-pixel or 1280-pixel observation resolution, so the main controller
stays at 320 × 240 while the complete anatomical renderer remains 1280 × 960.
See `scripts/compare_control_resolution.py` and `scripts/compare_event_support.py`.


## Anatomical visual-input trial

The earlier visual-input controller remains at `?controller=visual-seeded`. It retains the
complete anatomy and measured graph while supplying bounded external currents to
all **11,391 annotated visual afferents**, alongside 700 constant seed cells.
Another 127,152 cells receive the existing conductance control, and the 12 motor
outputs remain unactuated. This does not reconstruct a biological retina: the
external controller still imposes the image information.

The trial uses a denser requested rate scale of 180 Hz. No membrane, spike or
brightness is overwritten. Direct-input and synapse-dependent spikes are counted
separately in the UI. The displayed optical fractions integrate complete arbors
in the 320 × 240 control projection; they describe emitted light, not information
origin or a guarantee about another camera angle.

On the 60 tuning frames, supported MSE improves from 0.005244 to 0.003382, but one
of the three matched final corridor frames has worse edges. This mixed result
kept that version separate from the then-default event controller. `visual-input-comparison.png`
shows actual spike light for both controllers at the same exposure.

A frozen, new 640 × 480 / 35 FPS input uses maps 13, 18 and 24. All 120 input and
output frames are distinct, with persistent history across both cuts. The best
of the tested temporal lags is zero in each scene. Mean image correlations are
0.760 / 0.747 / 0.654 and edge cosines 0.402 / 0.424 / 0.313. Fine recognition
still fails; these are different maps from previous holdouts, not a before/after
comparison. The UI links `recorded-visual-comparison.mp4`, an actual-spike diagnostic
that is never read by the runtime. Archived controller sources and input hashes
are checked by `scripts/evaluate_frozen_sequence.py`.

In that holdout, 82.9% of projected light comes from cells requiring incoming
events, 16.1% from directly stimulated visual inputs and 1.0% from constant seeds.
After transmission is cut and state reset, the visual inputs and seeds still
fire; every other cell has zero spikes and there are zero synaptic deliveries.
A separate three-cell GPU test checks connected propagation, disconnected direct
input activity, and complete silence with stimulation also disabled.

`scripts/audit_input_capacity.py` supplies a conditional anatomical bound that
fixes observed seed brightness and constrains unreachable cells to zero. It does
not simulate attainable rates. On the stationary map02 target, adding visual
afferents reduces the optimistic bound from approximately 0.002596 to 0.001946.
Inhibition, current limits, timing and spike noise can only make the actual
controller harder to solve; the bound is never used as rendered neural output.


The production visual-input UI measures 10.73 new neural displays/s in both the
paired and enlarged views on the M5 Pro. Mean processing latency is 74.7 / 74.2 ms
(p95 83.7 / 82.6 ms), with the full anatomy and native body active. Each measured
window contains 120 distinct source times. Decoder-to-draw means are 91.4 / 90.5 ms;
physical display scan-out is excluded. See `event-visual-live-performance.json`.
These timing checks do not establish recognizable fine detail.


## Visual inputs without constant seeds (320-control stage)

The home page, `live.html`, and `?controller=visual-inputs` now open the improved
visual-input trial. It keeps every neuron and branch, directly stimulates the
11,391 annotated visual afferents, and applies external conductance control to
127,852 other cells. The 12 identified motor outputs remain unactuated. There
are **no constant seed currents**. All non-visual cells need incoming events to
fire in the tested model, while the external controls still impose the image.

The external preparation is now 0.01 mV below the unchanged firing threshold
(`gateBias=6.99`, versus the original 6.8 mV bias above rest). The extremely strong
conductance is 327,680 times the baseline leak, increased to retain suppression
when a cell should stay dark. This is engineered control, not a physiological
stimulation protocol. It leaves the measured contacts, membrane equation,
threshold, refractory period and own-spike brightness readout intact.

On the three matched tuning frames, edge similarity improves from 0.313 / 0.364 /
0.350 to 0.362 / 0.411 / 0.374. Mean supported error over all 60 tuning frames
falls from 0.003382 to 0.003205. A dark cut leaves mean light around 1.8e-12 after
one simulated second, with zero new gated spikes in the last 100 ms. The new
`weak-input-comparison.png` shows measured output at equal exposure. These are
partial improvements; fine-detail recognition still fails.

After freezing this controller, new maps 06, 20 and 29 were generated. The
120-frame neural evaluation decodes the source through a **browser File object
and object URL**, with all frames distinct and history preserved through both
cuts. Image correlations are 0.764 / 0.758 / 0.812 and edge cosines 0.510 / 0.513 /
0.535. These different maps cannot establish a before/after improvement. The
linked `recorded-weak-input-comparison.mp4` is a recorded diagnostic, never a
runtime source of neural activity. Across this reel, 85.6% of complete-projection
light comes from cells requiring incoming events; 14.4% comes from directly
stimulated visual inputs. This describes light contribution, not information origin.

`source-test.html` on the development server separately checks H.264 MP4 File
playback, a generated portrait WebM File, aspect-preserving letterboxing, and
recovery after invalid input. It passed using the actual browser decoder.
The native picker itself remains unverified because its Open button was disabled
in the automation session. File-path decoding is now tested separately from that
picker issue; no extension permissions were widened.


That 320-control production version measures 10.76 new displays/s in the paired view
and 10.79 in the enlarged view, with mean processing latency 73.4 / 72.7 ms and
p95 83.5 / 81.8 ms. All 270 anatomy chunks and the 1280 × 960 complete-branch
cache are present, with native body physics active. Each window contains 120
distinct source times. Decoder-to-draw means are 88.5 / 88.0 ms, excluding physical
scan-out. Results are in `weak-input-live-performance.json`; speed is still
separate from the unmet fine-detail recognition criterion.


## September 15 checkpoint

The current 640 × 480 controller has a frozen 120-frame File-object evaluation
with maps 05, 09 and 16. All decoded targets and emitted frames were distinct;
85.7% of complete-projection light came from cells requiring incoming events.
Cutting transmission after reset silenced those cells. Fine edge recognition
still fails, and production performance at this finer setting is not yet
validated. An initial live readout was below the 10-frame/s target.

**Save measurements** exports the latest 120 completed neural GPU draws, source
frame identities, latency, geometry counts, physics state and causal counters as
local JSON. Pause/resume, source and viewpoint changes, and interventions start
new measurement windows without resetting neural history. Partial windows are
explicitly identified. The export's statistics pass unit checks, and its JSON download was verified
on the production RGB build. See FULL_BRAIN_PROGRESS.md for the measurement scope.

Generated datasets, anatomy/operator files, videos, checkpoints and validation
caches are excluded from Git. Recreate them using the preparation commands above;
a fresh source checkout does not contain the multi-gigabyte brain assets.
